Any better combination/product for white counter top?	~ For chips, cracks, pits, gouges, reattaching or rebuilding lost stone pieces, or for the ultimate counter top installation adhesive, you need II 29. When dry II 29 is an impenetrable solid shield that is an unbreakable bond. Even our own UV cure repair kits do not compare to the durability of II 29. II 29 is completely non-toxic, food-safe and simple to use. For years I.I. 29 has been the #1 install and rapid-repair epoxy used by the pro's. The extended 15 minute application time allows for proper alignment and application for repairing or installing without needing to rush...then instantly dries after the application time is up. So you don't wait for projects to dry. I.I. 29 strongly bonds to most all projects all around the house... not just stone and tile. See our EZ-TINT pigments for tinting instructions //// REBUILDING MISSING CHIPS: After tinting, fill the epoxy into the repair area. Shape into place. Let dry. Razor off the excess and continue shaping with safety razor. //// CHIPPED STONE: No tint needed if you have a clean break where the piece can be reattached tightly. Apply epoxy to one side and push firmly into place. Always clamp for the most invisible of seams or tape tightly down with duct tape. //// CRACKS: Cracks must be wide as a credit card for the epoxy to be able to fill the crack. After tinting the epoxy, fill crack to the surface. Allow to self level for a glossy finish or once excess is dried, razor the surface level for a matted, travertine type finish. Remains flexible for hours if you decide to dig out attempt until you get exactly the finished look you desire. /////// COUNTER TOP INSTALLATION: Joint lines do not need to be taped since amazingly, the dried excess will not stick to the slick finished surfaces. Simply mix equal amounts of Resin and Hardener and apply to one or both edges. Clamp for maximum bond. Do not remove uncured excess epoxy. Let dry then simply razor off the excess in apx. 30 minutes once excess is dry-to-touch.	ask_question

When dry II 29 is an impenetrable solid shield that is an unbreakable bond. Even our own UV cure repair kits do not compare to the durability of II 29. II 29 is completely non-toxic, food-safe and simple to use. For years I.I. 29 has been the #1 install and rapid-repair epoxy used by the pro's. The extended 15 minute application time allows for proper alignment and application for repairing or installing without needing to rush...then instantly dries after the application time is up. So you don't wait for projects to dry. I.I. 29 strongly bonds to most all projects all around the house... not just stone and tile. See our EZ-TINT pigments for tinting instructions //// REBUILDING MISSING CHIPS: After tinting, fill the epoxy into the repair area. Shape into place. Let dry. Razor off the excess and continue shaping with safety razor. //// CHIPPED STONE: No tint needed if you have a clean break where the piece can be reattached tightly. Apply epoxy to one side and push firmly into place. Always clamp for the most invisible of seams or tape tightly down with duct tape. //// CRACKS: Cracks must be wide as a credit card for the epoxy to be able to fill the crack. After tinting the epoxy, fill crack to the surface. Allow to self level for a glossy finish or once excess is dried, razor the surface level for a matted, travertine type finish. Remains flexible for hours if you decide to dig out attempt until you get exactly the finished look you desire. /////// COUNTER TOP INSTALLATION: Joint lines do not need to be taped since amazingly, the dried excess will not stick to the slick finished surfaces. Simply mix equal amounts of Resin and Hardener and apply to one or both edges. Clamp for maximum bond. Do not remove uncured excess epoxy.

922	How long is the tubing?	Dual Head Cardiology Stethoscope: Real World Review by myself an ER Physician with 25 years experience: This is an excellent stethoscope choice if you are in the market for a large heavy Dual Head Cardiology model like the Littman Cardiology 3. Looks, size, and weight are virtually identical. The function is very good in my opinion as someone who has been using stethoscopes the past 25 years. We have improved this model with each production. Ear Tips are now a soft silicone and no longer screw on but push over the binaural exactly like Littman and will not unscrew or fall off. Both diaphragms are tune-able and respond with a simple pressure change to capture low and high-frequency sounds. Our mission is to provide less expensive medical diagnostics that have excellent function and to stand behind the products we sell. We also include a Lifetime warranty that covers the binaural, tubing and stainless steel stethoscope head. We include 2 sets of spare ear tips and a set of spare diaphragms with each stethoscope. **Comparison Pictures are meant to only show a comparison of our model and the Littman Cardiology 3 it is NOT an offer to purchase both stethoscopes **	ask_question

942	Can you use it to Identify semiprecious gemstone beads?	The Gemological refractometer is considered by many to be the most important of all gem testing instruments. The primary use of the refractometer is to measure the angle at which light traveling through the stone is bent or refracted. This is called Refractive Index (R.I.). As Refractive Index is usually different for different gemstones, this provides an important clue for accurate gemstone identification. Gemological refractometer also can be used to determine whether or not a stone is single or double refracting. For doubly refracting stone, based on the difference between 2 readings you obtain from the refractometer, strength of the gemstone's double refraction (birefringence) may be computed and it offers an important gem identification aid, as it differs from gem to gem. Also refractometer is one of the few instruments capable to give you information for opaque stones as well as transparent stones. Quality of the instrument is important to enable you to perform consistent and reliable test for years to come. Our refractometer has all metal construction with built-in light (no flashlight or any other light source required) and polarizing filter, allowing you to perform all needed tests, it comes with vinyl soft case with belt loop for convenience while traveling and hard case for safe storage.

947	DOES THIS ITEM HAVE A BUILT IN LIGHTING	The Gemological refractometer is considered by many to be the most important of all gem testing instruments. The primary use of the refractometer is to measure the angle at which light traveling through the stone is bent or refracted. This is called Refractive Index (R.I.). As Refractive Index is usually different for different gemstones, this provides an important clue for accurate gemstone identification. Gemological refractometer also can be used to determine whether or not a stone is single or double refracting. For doubly refracting stone, based on the difference between 2 readings you obtain from the refractometer, strength of the gemstone's double refraction (birefringence) may be computed and it offers an important gem identification aid, as it differs from gem to gem. Also refractometer is one of the few instruments capable to give you information for opaque stones as well as transparent stones. Quality of the instrument is important to enable you to perform consistent and reliable test for years to come. Our refractometer has all metal construction with built-in light (no flashlight or any other light source required) and polarizing filter, allowing you to perform all needed tests, it comes with vinyl soft case with belt loop for convenience while traveling and hard case for safe storage.

"Replace the inaccurate stock height gauge on your portable planer and stop constantly using calipers to check stock thickness! Most digital calipers only read out in decimal measurements, forcing you to do the mental math to convert to fractions. If your stock is measuring .575"" and you need 9/16"", how much do you need to remove with your next pass through the planer? With the Digital Planer Height Gauge simply lower your planer until the gauge reads .565 - 9/16. It can\'t get any easier! Unique gauge reads out both decimal and fractional measurements. Fits most portable ""lunch box"" style planers. Easy to follow installation instructions.', 'This precision gauge has an angled display for easy viewing as well as ""auto shut off."" And it fits most portable woodworking planers. It easily mounts to Dewalt, Delta, Ridgid, Ryobi, Makita, Craftsman, and others. It mounts in minutes and is calibrated in seconds. It displays the thickness of the wood coming out the back of the planer in inches with fractions or millimeters. It is easy to attach the WR510 to your portable planer. It comes with simple mounting brackets and detailed instructions that allow you to mount this on many models without even drilling a single hole. Calibration takes only seconds with its patented calibration system. The WR510 uses a piece of freshly planed board to ensure the readout displays the exact thickness of wood coming out the back of your planer. The large easy to read display reads in inches with fractions or millimeters. The fractions are displayed using Precise Fraction Technology which gives you 4 times the accuracy of other fraction readouts. The decimal inches are displayed in .005-inch increments, the fractions in 1/32-inch, and the millimeters in .1mm increments. Accuracy is .0025 decimal inches, 1/500 fraction inches, and .05mm metric. Once it is set up and calibrated, the WR510 consistently displays the thickness of wood coming out the back of your planer. It never needs re-calibrated unless the battery is replaced or the blades get worn down.

2036	Is there a disadvantage to not having a wand?	', 'The Radiation Alert Inspector Xtreme is a hand-held, microprocessor-based radiation detector that detects potentially harmful ionizing alpha and beta particles, and gamma and x-ray radiation, has a four-digit, LCD digital display of millirem (mR) per hour and additional functions, and comes with a protective rubber boot. This radiation detector has the ability to detect low levels of the four main types of ionizing alpha and beta particles, and gamma rays and x-rays over automatic operational ranges. It is optimized to detect small changes (low levels) in radiation levels and to have high sensitivity to many common radionuclides.', 'The Inspector Xtreme counts ionizing radiation changes, and the unit of measurement is selected and displayed using the mode switch. The display shows various indicators, based on the mode setting, the function performed, and remaining battery power. These include low battery, alert, timer, total mode (to see the number of times a reading should be multiplied by to obtain the correct radiation count), calibration mode, utility menu (timer, calibration, alarm set mode), and units of measurement. It has automatic operational ranges for a variety of radiation detection. A red, flashing counter, and a beeping noise indicate each ionizing radiation change event. The display updates every three seconds. At low background levels, which are typical in a geographic area, the update is the moving average for the most recent 30-second time period. The time period for the moving average decreases, as radiation levels increase. The radiation detector has a 2, halogen-quenched, uncompensated Geiger Mueller (GM) tube with a thin, mica end window for sensing ionizing radiation. A radiation symbol on the front label marks the center of the detector. It is used for surveying naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) contamination, gross wipe counting, contamination inspection of packages, equipment, and people, regulatory inspections, and for low energy radionuclide detection. This detector has a utility menu on the back of the unit. The menu has a three-second response, and switches the detector from mR/hr and counts per minute (CPM) to &mu;Sv/hr and counts per second (CPS). It also can reset the calibration factor to 100, adjust calibration, and reset all settings to the default factory setting. The radiation detector has an audio indicator with an internally mounted beeper that can be turned off for silent operation. It comes with a protective rubber boot with access to an operational panel; batteries are sold separately.

They sense ionizing radiation with an enclosed Geiger Mueller (GM) tube to count radiation particles or rays. Alpha and beta particles are measured in counts per minute (CPM) or counts per second (CPS). Gamma rays and x-rays are measured in milliRoentgens (mR) per hour, microSieverts (&mu;Sv) per hour, or milliSieverts (mSv) per hour. Alpha particles are positively charged and heavier than beta particles, and have a limited range of approximately 3 to 5 centimeters by air. Alpha particles can be shielded by objects such as paper and unopened skin. High-energy beta particles are electrons, heavier than gamma rays, and can take either a positive or negative charge. Beta particles can be shielded by aluminum or wood. High-frequency (short wavelength) gamma rays are the strongest and lightest rays. Gamma rays are more penetrating than alpha and beta particles. They can be shielded by dense materials such as lead, and large masses of concrete, hardened steel, or water. X-rays are man-made gamma rays, and have essentially the same properties and function.

Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries.', 'United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope.

2430	"Do you guys have a rebuild kit? The pump I have after about 18 months of ""heavy"" needs rebuilding."	"Diesel / Biodiesel Pumps 40, 60 & 80 Series Light Oil Pumps Not for use with vegetable oil and other such heavy oils These pumps are designed for light oil pumping applications such as diesel fuel, biodiesel and kerosene. These pumps cannot handle thicker oils such as vegetable oil, transmission fluid or motor oil. Fit with Viton seals, they are 100% biodiesel compatible. Use this pump for fueling vehicles, transfering fluids, filtering fluids & more. The primary function of this pump is for fueling vehicles with an automatic nozzle. The pump will build up pressure to 44 psi max and then be unable to pump anymore. No bypass is needed as the pump will not damage itself when the oil flow is stopped (usually by a nozzel) The pump should not be left on for a long period of time when restricted, as it will wear down the vanes, but it is ok for normal usage. Included with this pump are 2 straight hose barb fittings which use a viton oring to form a proper seal with the pump. Although the fittings on the pump are 1"" straight thread, most NPT fittings can be made to fit when using our yellow teflon tape."	ask_question

2526	Could you use this product as a magnetic dry erase board?	For best results: 1)Allow magnet to reach room temperature. 2)Unroll magnet. 3)Apply magnet's dark gray side to large metal surface for several hours to flatten curl. If applying to a painted vehicle, the vehicle's surface should be waxed a minimum of 48 hours in advance before applying magnetic sheeting. For new vehicles or newly painted vehicles, wait approximately 90 days for the paint to cure before applying magnetic sheeting. Caution: Avoid repainted surfaces, non-metallic body fillers and wood grain vinyl siding. Wipe the surface of the vehicle with a clean dry cloth before application and make sure that all grime, dust, and dirt has been removed. It is best to apply flexible magnetic sheeting when the temperature of magnet is around room temperature or about 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Carefully align one edge of the flexible magnetic sheet to the vehicle's surface. Allow the remainder of the sheet to apply itself to the vehicle's surface. Do not allow air pockets to form under the sheet. If not aligned correctly, be sure to completely remove the sheeting and start over again. Do not pull or drag the sheet to realign it. This can damage or stretch the material. TAKE CARE AND CLEAN magnetic sign by removing flexible magnet sheeting periodically to guard against moisture and dirt buildup. Trapped dirt between magnet and vehicle can damage its finish. Clean flexible magnetic sheeting as well as the surface to be re-applied weekly with a mild detergent, wipe with a soft cloth and allow to dry.

This handy vacuum cleaner stores all of its collected dust and debris in a backpack canister, allowing you to clean without any obstructions. As one year-old toddlers often weigh less than 10 lbs., so does the C2401 backpack vacuum! The C2401 vacuum cleaner is also compact so that you can clean out narrow passageways, small spaces, as well as large areas with ease and comfort. The C2401 can carry up to 6.4 quarts of dust and debris. You can also monitor its dust capacity with its clear dome lid so it is easy to know when to empty its collection bag. The C2401 can be used with a shake out cloth liner or with a disposable paper bag insert, allowing you the flexibility of choices and options needed for a versatile cleaning job.

3252	What do you clean the acrylic with before using this or Weld-On 16? I am doing a seam reinforcement job with a square acrylic dowel.	Moderately Fast-Setting Solvent Cement for Bonding Acrylic. WELD-ON 4 is a water-thin, somewhat flammable cement formulated to quickly develop very clear and high strength bonds for many thermoplastic substrates. The bond is achieved by first softening the surfaces to be joined and then fusing them together with the dissipation of the solvent. The initial bond forms within a matter of minutes and is followed by a significant and continual increase in bond strength over the next several hours. WELD-ON 4 may be preferred by some plastic fabricators because it is less likely to leave white marks (commonly called blushing). For similar applications but faster setting cement, WELD-ON 3 is recommended. Weld-On 4 Acrylic Adhesive water thin, somewhat flammable, moderately fast-setting, blush-resistant solvent cement for bonding acrylic. It will also bond with other thermoplastics such as polystyrene, CAB (cellulose acetate butyrate), and polycarbonate to themselves. Does not bond to cross-linked acrylics. SUBSTRATE RECOMMENDATIONS : WELD-ON 4 is formulated as a blush-resistant cement for bonding acrylic (poly-methyl methacrylate) to itself. It will also form strong bonds with other thermoplastics such as polystyrene, CAB (cellulose acetate butyrate), and polycarbonate to themselves. It is not recommended for cross-linked acrylic. SUGGESTED BONDING APPLICATIONS: WELD-ON 4 is used extensively in sign fabrication for cementing acrylic letters to fat acrylic presentation panels and trim-capping of cut out acrylic letters. Strong butt joints are made with fat sheets by using the soak method. WELD-ON 4 is also widely used in many applications e.g. fabrication of display and presentation cases, medical equipment assembly, the bonding of plastic containers and pre-forms, and in the manufacture of numerous solvent welded structures and subassemblies using the capillary method.

Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell- White Gorilla Tape is the perfect duct tape for both indoor and outdoor use. It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, its made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Directions: Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla Tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. Thats it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until theyre needed. Gorilla Tape works best at temperatures above 32F (0C). For best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla Tape freezes, it will work just fine once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla Tape should not be used as an electrical tape.

Tired of noisy centrifuges? Anyone that has experienced having multiple centrifuges running simultaneously can attest to fact that this noise brings both distraction and discomfort to the workplace. As such, the XC-1000 features one of our proprietary quiet motors generating an operating noise level of under 70 dB, in the hopes of helping you maintain a quiet and comfortable work environment. It is common knowledge that work areas are considered prime real estate in most labs and it is with this in mind that the XC-1000s compact frame was specially designed to maximize your workspace. Now with your safety in mind, the XC-1000 centrifuge has been designed with an auto-stop feature that is triggered when the centrifuge lid is opened before they cycle is completed. This feature is intended to help avoid injury and reduce instances of tube breakage and contamination of the unit. Along with this, are three suctioned feet that will hold the unit in place, reducing vibrations and avoiding any slipping and shifting of the unit. For over 25 years Premiere has been making dependable laboratory centrifuges that stand the test of time. The Premiere XC-1000 is CE certified and is manufactured at our ISO 9001 certified factory; so whether you are running PRP, PRF, cell washing or simple fluid separation protocols, the XC-1000 is the ideal choice for medical, scientific, clinical and industrial applications and is backed by our comprehensive 1 year warranty against manufacturers defects. If you prefer a centrifuge with variable speed options, then please check out our XC-2000 centrifuge ASIN # B00EP0T6GU, or better yet, please refer to the chart below which illustrates the key points which differentiate our four compact models.	ask_question

3956	If I apply this to the outside windshield of my car, will it repel water? Also,how long will the first application last before I will have to reapply?	The Ultra-Ever Dry is a super-hydrophobic (water) and oleo-phobic (hydrocarbons) coating that will completely repel almost any liquid. Ultra-Ever Dry uses proprietary nanotechnology to coat an object and create a barrier of air on its surface. This barrier repels water, refined oil, wet concrete, and other liquids unlike any other coating. Ultra-Ever Dry has vastly improved adhesion and abrasion resistance, compared to previous technologies, allowing it to be used in applications where greater durability is required. Self-Cleaning - The Ultra-Ever Dry repels dirty water and thick oils, and remains clean and virtually bacteria-free. When dust, dirt or other molecules accumulate on a superhyrophobic coated surface, a light spray of water or a blast of air grabs the dust and removes it. Ultra-Ever Dry is a TWO-part system. Both the Bottom Coat and Top Coat must be applied for the product to be effective.

"<div class=""aplus"">', 'The Mitutoyo 500-196-30 digital caliper has a 0 to 6"" (0 to 150mm) measuring range with 0.0005"" (0.01mm) increments for precision and an advanced onsite sensor (AOS) electromagnetic inductive sensor for resistance to dirt, oil, and water. Its digital readout LCD shows inch or metric units for versatility, and allows either absolute or incremental measurement readings. The electronic caliper measures inside, outside, depth, and step values for versatility and includes a protective case and SR44 silver oxide battery.', 'Digital calipers are measuring instruments commonly used for inspection in manufacturing to provide the precise measurements of an object. A pair of jaws attached to a long beam with a marked scale is used to take inside, outside, and step measurements. An additional depth probe slides along the beam to take depth measurements. One jaw is fixed to the end of the scale, while the other jaw slides along it with gearless precision to take measurements. The reading is electronically generated and displayed on a digital, high-resolution screen as a single value. Digital calipers can take differential measurements, which are used to determine the difference in measurements between two objects, by zeroing the display at any point along the scale. Some digital calipers can switch between standard and metric units, and some can output readings to a computer or printer for recording measurements. Compared to dial calipers, digital calipers provide measurements that are faster, easier, and more error-free, but they are more fragile mechanically and electronically, and do not resist coolant well. Vernier calipers are more durable than digital calipers because they do not have internal moving parts, but they can be more difficult to read. Digital calipers are commonly used in fields such as metalworking, mechanical engineering, machining, carpentry, and medicine.', 'Mitutoyo manufactures precision measuring tools, metrology equipment, and related systems.
