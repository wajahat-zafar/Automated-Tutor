It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, its made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Directions: Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla Tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. Thats it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until theyre needed. Gorilla Tape works best at temperatures above 32F (0C). For best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla Tape freezes, it will work just fine once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla Tape should not be used as an electrical tape. Weve found that Gorilla Tape will last a lot longer than regular duct tapes when it comes in contact with moisture.

Thanks to proprietary 3M Science, this transparent tape is exceptionally strong and lasts longer than other 3M heavy-duty gray duct tapes. Perfect for tough repairs like repairing patio furniture or patching a leaky garden hose, this heavy-duty tape is water resistant and stands up to direct sunlight. This tape hand tears, resists sticking to itself and adheres to a variety of surfaces, making it super easy to use on the job. Let your repairs fly under the radar without sacrificing performance with 3M TRANSPARENT Duct Tape."", 'It\'s not often the word revolutionary can be associated with duct tape, that old, sticky standby used in plumbing repairs, hockey stick augmentation, and homeland security protection. By getting the gray out--and avoiding the ""sore thumb"" look of typical duct tape repairs--3M\'s Scotch Transparent Duct Tape can indeed lay claim to a revolution of the toolbox. But seeing through it is just the start. This duct tape can be easily torn by hand, is UV resistant, and, through accelerated weathering tests, has been shown to last six times longer than its old-school namesake.', 'Duct tape has been around since 1942 when the military needed a waterproof tape for sealing ammunition boxes. Originally colored green, it was referred to as ""duck tape"" due to its moisture resistance as well as its cotton duck construction--the same ribbed cloth used in bandages. After the war, it was adopted by contractors working in the booming housing industry, where it got its ""duct"" name for easily connecting heating and air conditioning ducts.', ""History's fine, but what can 3M's new, clear duct tape do for us? Virtually anything. First, we noticed its powerful stickiness--the roll itself adheres to just about any surface when laid on its side. As advertised, the tape was easily torn from the roll by hand with minimal force. 3M also seems to have ironed out one of the biggest complaints about duct tape: wrinkles. In our testing, we applied it repeatedly and evenly without the tape sticking to itself and without creating odd bumps and creases. And while the tape is rather sticky, it doesn't go overboard, easily lifting off surfaces when we needed it to and not leaving the tacky, viscous residue often found with other duct tapes."", 'As for its transparency, the tape blended well into just about any surface we applied it to. It was never ""invisible"" but did have the chameleon-like quality of reflecting the surface beneath it and only calling attention to itself when caught in direct light. Also, we placed bands of the tape over our computer monitor before writing this review (don\'t try this at home, kids). Peering through the fabric ribs was a nuisance, but we were able to compose the description you\'re now reading. How\'s <i>that</i> for transparency?', ""Our only complaint is that, as with most transparent tapes, finding where to start peeling the roll can be difficult. While this certainly isn't a showstopper, we did find a solution: mounting the roll onto a tape gun."", ""Tape, by its nature, is not a terribly exciting product (or topic).

Will this product work to fill the gap and look decent w/blk coloring?"	~ For chips, cracks, pits, gouges, reattaching or rebuilding lost stone pieces, or for the ultimate counter top installation adhesive, you need II 29. When dry II 29 is an impenetrable solid shield that is an unbreakable bond. Even our own UV cure repair kits do not compare to the durability of II 29. II 29 is completely non-toxic, food-safe and simple to use. For years I.I. 29 has been the #1 install and rapid-repair epoxy used by the pro's. The extended 15 minute application time allows for proper alignment and application for repairing or installing without needing to rush...then instantly dries after the application time is up. So you don't wait for projects to dry. I.I. 29 strongly bonds to most all projects all around the house... not just stone and tile. See our EZ-TINT pigments for tinting instructions //// REBUILDING MISSING CHIPS: After tinting, fill the epoxy into the repair area. Shape into place. Let dry. Razor off the excess and continue shaping with safety razor. //// CHIPPED STONE: No tint needed if you have a clean break where the piece can be reattached tightly. Apply epoxy to one side and push firmly into place. Always clamp for the most invisible of seams or tape tightly down with duct tape. //// CRACKS: Cracks must be wide as a credit card for the epoxy to be able to fill the crack. After tinting the epoxy, fill crack to the surface. Allow to self level for a glossy finish or once excess is dried, razor the surface level for a matted, travertine type finish. Remains flexible for hours if you decide to dig out attempt until you get exactly the finished look you desire. /////// COUNTER TOP INSTALLATION: Joint lines do not need to be taped since amazingly, the dried excess will not stick to the slick finished surfaces. Simply mix equal amounts of Resin and Hardener and apply to one or both edges. Clamp for maximum bond. Do not remove uncured excess epoxy. Let dry then simply razor off the excess in apx. 30 minutes once excess is dry-to-touch.	ask_question

2036	Is there a disadvantage to not having a wand?	', 'The Radiation Alert Inspector Xtreme is a hand-held, microprocessor-based radiation detector that detects potentially harmful ionizing alpha and beta particles, and gamma and x-ray radiation, has a four-digit, LCD digital display of millirem (mR) per hour and additional functions, and comes with a protective rubber boot. This radiation detector has the ability to detect low levels of the four main types of ionizing alpha and beta particles, and gamma rays and x-rays over automatic operational ranges. It is optimized to detect small changes (low levels) in radiation levels and to have high sensitivity to many common radionuclides.', 'The Inspector Xtreme counts ionizing radiation changes, and the unit of measurement is selected and displayed using the mode switch. The display shows various indicators, based on the mode setting, the function performed, and remaining battery power. These include low battery, alert, timer, total mode (to see the number of times a reading should be multiplied by to obtain the correct radiation count), calibration mode, utility menu (timer, calibration, alarm set mode), and units of measurement. It has automatic operational ranges for a variety of radiation detection. A red, flashing counter, and a beeping noise indicate each ionizing radiation change event. The display updates every three seconds. At low background levels, which are typical in a geographic area, the update is the moving average for the most recent 30-second time period. The time period for the moving average decreases, as radiation levels increase. The radiation detector has a 2, halogen-quenched, uncompensated Geiger Mueller (GM) tube with a thin, mica end window for sensing ionizing radiation. A radiation symbol on the front label marks the center of the detector. It is used for surveying naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) contamination, gross wipe counting, contamination inspection of packages, equipment, and people, regulatory inspections, and for low energy radionuclide detection. This detector has a utility menu on the back of the unit. The menu has a three-second response, and switches the detector from mR/hr and counts per minute (CPM) to &mu;Sv/hr and counts per second (CPS). It also can reset the calibration factor to 100, adjust calibration, and reset all settings to the default factory setting. The radiation detector has an audio indicator with an internally mounted beeper that can be turned off for silent operation. It comes with a protective rubber boot with access to an operational panel; batteries are sold separately. The Inspector Extreme cannot be returned.', 'Radiation detectors can detect a broad range of ionizing alpha and beta particles, and gamma and x-rays that may be emitting harmful levels of radiation. They sense ionizing radiation with an enclosed Geiger Mueller (GM) tube to count radiation particles or rays. Alpha and beta particles are measured in counts per minute (CPM) or counts per second (CPS). Gamma rays and x-rays are measured in milliRoentgens (mR) per hour, microSieverts (&mu;Sv) per hour, or milliSieverts (mSv) per hour. Alpha particles are positively charged and heavier than beta particles, and have a limited range of approximately 3 to 5 centimeters by air. Alpha particles can be shielded by objects such as paper and unopened skin. High-energy beta particles are electrons, heavier than gamma rays, and can take either a positive or negative charge. Beta particles can be shielded by aluminum or wood. High-frequency (short wavelength) gamma rays are the strongest and lightest rays. Gamma rays are more penetrating than alpha and beta particles. They can be shielded by dense materials such as lead, and large masses of concrete, hardened steel, or water. X-rays are man-made gamma rays, and have essentially the same properties and function. Radiation detectors commonly have either an analog or a digital display. Analog radiation detectors output with a needle-point scale, and digital units generate a numerical LCD digit display.

The oscilloscope has maximum real-time sample rate of 100MS/s and a record length of 6,000 points for acquiring detailed waveforms. Its 18 automatic measurements such as period, frequency, and peak-to-peak enable an in-depth analysis of waveforms. Up to four waveforms can be stored in the internal memory. The multimeter has two ranging modes: manual, which allows the user to select the operating range, and auto, which automatically selects the appropriate operating range. The delta relative function allows a measurement to be set as a reference value and displays subsequent measurements as a positive or negative deviation from that value, and the data-hold function freezes a reading on the display to aid documentation. A continuity buzzer confirms that the circuit conducts electricity, and a diode check detects whether a circuit\'s diodes are working properly. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/BISS/OscilloscopesMix/B004KTFZAC.user_manual.pdf#page=62"" target=_blank>Additional specifications</a> include a rise time of 17.5 ns and various triggering features.

Oscilloscopes measure the voltage of an electrical signal over time, and display the measurement as a waveform in a visual graph. The waveform shows the sweeps (or refresh) of voltage on a vertical (Y) axis, and the time on a horizontal (X) axis. Details of a waveform demonstrate the signal over time. Most oscilloscopes have two or four channels for inputting a signal. Some digital oscilloscopes offer more than four channels, allowing channels to be dedicated to specific signals and applications. Bandwidth is the maximum frequency of a signal that an oscilloscope can capture. A constant image will display if a signal is shown at a high frequency. Oscilloscopes may be analog, digital, or mixed signal. An analog oscilloscope directly displays an input signal as a continuous waveform, typically in a luminous phosphor on a cathode ray tube (CRT). A digital oscilloscope converts the input signal into a digital format and reassembles the waveform for display, typically on an LCD. A mixed signal oscilloscope (MSO) displays both analog and digital formats. Some oscilloscopes can display more than one channel and type of measurement simultaneously. Some oscilloscopes can capture waveform signals to memory, and recall them. They may provide real-time intensity grading, and may have the ability to adjust frequency of display.

This duct tape can be easily torn by hand, is UV resistant, and, through accelerated weathering tests, has been shown to last six times longer than its old-school namesake.', 'Duct tape has been around since 1942 when the military needed a waterproof tape for sealing ammunition boxes. Originally colored green, it was referred to as ""duck tape"" due to its moisture resistance as well as its cotton duck construction--the same ribbed cloth used in bandages. After the war, it was adopted by contractors working in the booming housing industry, where it got its ""duct"" name for easily connecting heating and air conditioning ducts.', ""History's fine, but what can 3M's new, clear duct tape do for us? Virtually anything. First, we noticed its powerful stickiness--the roll itself adheres to just about any surface when laid on its side. As advertised, the tape was easily torn from the roll by hand with minimal force. 3M also seems to have ironed out one of the biggest complaints about duct tape: wrinkles. In our testing, we applied it repeatedly and evenly without the tape sticking to itself and without creating odd bumps and creases. And while the tape is rather sticky, it doesn't go overboard, easily lifting off surfaces when we needed it to and not leaving the tacky, viscous residue often found with other duct tapes."", 'As for its transparency, the tape blended well into just about any surface we applied it to. It was never ""invisible"" but did have the chameleon-like quality of reflecting the surface beneath it and only calling attention to itself when caught in direct light. Also, we placed bands of the tape over our computer monitor before writing this review (don\'t try this at home, kids). Peering through the fabric ribs was a nuisance, but we were able to compose the description you\'re now reading.
